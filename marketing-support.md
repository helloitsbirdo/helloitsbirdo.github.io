# Marketing Support

There are two different types of marketing that Parity can assist with, both should only be used for new feature announcements, milestones in terms of usage or major partnership / BD deals.

1️⃣ The weekly round up or retweets / comments on announcement posts

These are great for amplifying your message to the Polkadot community, these are best used for major feature announcements and milestones.

e.g.

- A quote tweet with additional information about the milestone→ [https://twitter.com/Polkadot/status/1689276019847401473?s=20](https://twitter.com/Polkadot/status/1689276019847401473?s=20)
- The weekly Polkadot round up showcasing different projects → [https://twitter.com/Polkadot/status/1688573364539998208?s=20](https://twitter.com/Polkadot/status/1688573364539998208?s=20)

For this level of support, please email social@parity.io and cc your success manager

2️⃣ Co-marketing / original content

Co-marketing / original content should be for major announcements, major deals.

These are tweets originated by the Polkadot account on twitter / threads etc without RTing content from another annoucement

e.g.

- A tweet thread about the Polkadot Blockchain academy [https://twitter.com/Polkadot/status/1681593309246914561?s=20](https://twitter.com/Polkadot/status/1681593309246914561?s=20)
