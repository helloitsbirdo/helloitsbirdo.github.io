# Telegram communities

Many project teams have their own telegram communities, these are typically faster paced than discord conversations.

There are several co-ordination channels setup for activities in the Polkadot ecosystem, specifically regarding Marketing and Business Development / Growth opportunities. 

Please reach out to your account manager for an introduction for yourself or your team members.
