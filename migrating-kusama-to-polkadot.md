# Migrating from Kusama to Polkadot

One route several teams have taken is to migrate their Parachain from Kusama to Polkadot, this means the product no longer functions on Kusama but only on Polkadot after the migration.

Several teams (Kilt, Zietgiest & Subsocial) have been successful with this migration and thanks to the Zietgiest team they have published two detailed documents / guides on how to do this.

Please see:
