# Parachain Templates

To accelerate the development and time-to-market of future Parachain projects, here are two ready-to-use, opinionated **Parachain templates**.

They serve as a solid starting point for a vast majority of projects, and integrates best practices the Parity team have gathered from building multiple projects over the last several years.

- **[Extended Parachain Template 7](https://github.com/paritytech/extended-parachain-template)**: A ready-for-hacking parachain template, pre-configured with the Assets pallet, and a governance system (Collective & Motion pallets), and other useful base features.
- **[Frontier Parachain Template 4](https://github.com/paritytech/frontier-parachain-template)**: a ready-to-use Frontier/EVM-based Parachain, pre-configured with the Assets pallet, a governance system (Collective & Motion pallets), and EVM precompiles.
