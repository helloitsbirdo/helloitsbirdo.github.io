# Polkadot OpenGov Overview

**Polkadot OpenGov launched** on Polkadot on June 15th 2023 - It represents the **next phase of Polkadot governance, bringing the next generation of** fully decentralized, unstoppable, and open governance to Web3.

It’s much more efficient than the previous governance system, and all central decision-making bodies were removed. Now, full control of **Polkadot and its treasury has been handed over to the community**, and their decisions are automatically carried out, on-chain.

Polkadot OpenGov plays a **major role** in: Decentralization, unstoppability, on-chain intelligence, and future-proofness (through upgradability).

### Threshold curves

For a proposal to move from the decision period to the enactment period, the voting turn out (support) needs to be met.
