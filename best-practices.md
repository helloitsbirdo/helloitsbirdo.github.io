# Best practises for community feedback

Here are some of the lessons learnt and advice for proposals on Polkadot OpenGov:

1. Ensure the account you are making the proposal with has an on-chain identity
2. If you are requesting funds from the treasury, it is recommended that these will be sent to a multisig.
3. As of August 2023, for treasury proposals, the community is focused typically on retroactive funding. Large requests of DOT without prior reputation or building experience in the ecosystem will likely get knocked back.
4. For best results as a new entrant to the ecosystem, start small, build your product and show experience, commitment and results. Requesting funds based on milestone payments tied to results is the best way to get the community onside with your proposals.
5. Before submitting your proposal on-chain, ensure you post it for discussion on Polkassembly. This phase could last 7-14d.
   1. Gather feedback from token holders on your proposal
   2. Post your proposal in the element channel: Polkadot Direction
   3. Tweet and share your proposal on any social platforms you have
   4. Join the AAG - this is a weekly live video series where proponents can bring their proposals to discuss them and generate awareness and community feedback.
6. It's YOUR job to convey why the proposal is useful and important to the Polkadot network.
7. Keep neutral and cool. Take on feedback / criticism to evolve your proposal if required. If your proposal doesn't pass on the first try, it's ok to try again after aligning it better with community feedback
