# Element chat

## Why we use it

Element is used by the Parity team because it fits the true web3 values of decentralisation and "less trust, more truth" principle. Itâ€™s fully end to end encrypted and has stronger controls than many other chat platforms (slack, discord).

- End-to-end encrypted channels allow company owners to even distrust administrators from leaking sensitive communication.
- Federated system, if a user has a matrix account on any server, they can join and communicate with us.
- Any user can create channels and invite colleagues or externals to the discussion without asking permission.
